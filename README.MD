## Project Requirements:

The brief that was assigned was to create an application that generates "objects" based upon a predefine rules.
* Service 1: The main service which will render templates used to interact with the application, this will be responsible for communicating with the services.
* Service 2: Generate a random object which will be used with the object generated from service 3, these will both be based on to generate an object for service 4.
* Service 3: Same objective as service 2.
* Service 4: Generate a final object, this will be determined based on the values generated by service 3 & 4.

### Constraints overview:
The tools I will use for each of the constraints are listed below:

* Kanban board: Trello
* Version Control: Git (GitHub) 
* CI server: Jenkins
* Configuration Manager: Ansible
* Cloud server: GCP virtual machines
* Containerisation: Docker
* Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm
* Reverse Proxy: NGINX

## Project Planning:  
I used a trello board to keep track off all the tasks needed to completed to create, run and build the app. The initial trello board is below:




## The App
The application I have chosen to build is an meal roulette generator.
The purpose of this application is to choose a random breakfast from a specific list I made and choose a random lunch meal from another list I made.
  
The application uses a microservice architecture, explained below:
* Service 1 - Front-End: This is where the user interacts with the web page and displays all the services combined

* Service 2 - breakfast API: GET request that generates a random breakfast meal

* Service 3 - lunch: GET request that generates a random lunch meal

* Service 4 - calories: Post requests which displays service 1 and adds up the calories off both the breakfast and lunch meals.

Altogether the appication will generate them a random breakfast meal and lunch and will tell the user the calories off both meals combined.

This shows a picture off my main and only screen you can see it generates the random breakfast and lunch and the calories off both meals together. As you refresh the page it will generate new set off information. 

This is another picture once a refresh has been done
