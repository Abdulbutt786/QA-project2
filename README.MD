## Project Requirements:

The brief that was assigned was to create an application that generates "objects" based upon a predefine rules.
*Service 1: The main service which will render templates used to interact with the application, this will be responsible for communicating with the services.
*Service 2: Generate a random object which will be used with the object generated from service 3, these will both be based on to generate an object for service 4.
*Service 3: Same objective as service 2.
*Service 4: Generate a final object, this will be determined based on the values generated by service 3 & 4.
